# Brain games

Hexlet educational project "Brain Games" is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again.

Games:

**Brain Even**: Answer "yes" if the number is even, otherwise answer "no".
**Brain Calculator**: Answer what is the result of the expression?
**Brain GCD**: Answer what is the greatest common divisor of given numbers.
**Brain Progression**: Answer what number is missing in the progression?
**Brain Prime**: Answer "yes" if given number is prime, otherwise answer "no".
